# Question

Why does the workflow rebuild & push a new Docker image even when Java code hasn't changed?

# Top Answers

1. **SHA-based tagging**: Every commit (including CI/config changes) uses a new SHA tag.
2. **Immutable registry**: ECR wonâ€™t reuse existing tags; missing tag triggers a fresh build.

# Reasons

* Guarantees reproducible deployments by binding images to commit SHAs.
* Prevents stale code; to reuse images, narrow triggers with path filters.
* Alternatively, retag existing manifest or use a stable tag like `latest`.
